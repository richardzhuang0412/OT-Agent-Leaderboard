-- Create leaderboard_results view for the leaderboard application
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor: Project → SQL Editor → New Query

-- This view returns ALL evaluation results from sandbox_jobs (Finished, Started, Pending)
-- Parses accuracy and accuracy_stderr from the metrics JSONB array for Finished jobs
-- Includes base model and duplicate tracking metadata
-- NO deduplication — the server selects which result to show per (model, agent, benchmark)

-- Drop existing view to recreate with new columns
